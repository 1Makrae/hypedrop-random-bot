# Hypedrop Random Bot
 A bot inspired by WatchGamesTV's video using chatgpt. 
 
I enjoy watching hypedrop videos in my spare time and would love to see other content creators 
use my program. I will likely come out with a version that allows favoriting of cases as well 
as removing cases from the case pool in the future. However, I will likely not be updating 
csv file with the cases very often since it takes forever to do so. 

Enjoy and good luck on your openings!

Notes:
1. Prices for the cases were last updated on January 4th 2023
2. The lowest value case that can be generated is proportional to the budget inputted.
    Higher budget means that low value cases are not included in the case pool
